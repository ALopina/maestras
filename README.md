# Maestras Exhibition Analysis

The Maestras project is an exploration and analysis of the ["Maestras"](https://www.museothyssen.org/exposiciones/maestras) exhibition, which celebrates the achievements of female artists from 16th to the beginning of 20th century. The project aims to shed light on the contributions, challenges, and impact of women artists in the art world.

By examining the lives, careers, and artistic output of these women, the project seeks to challenge traditional narratives and promote gender equality in the arts.

## Features

- Data collection: The project collects data on female artists featured in the Maestras exhibition, including their names, birth and death years, and various criteria such as early talent recognition, association with artistic families, involvement with academies, advocacy for equality, prolific output, travel experiences, authorship, museum ownership, and mentorship.
- Data analysis: The collected data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and insights into the backgrounds and accomplishments of female artists.
- Visualization: Visualizations such as treemaps, bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots are created to showcase the distribution of artists based on different criteria, identify top artists, and analyze the distribution of artists by century.
